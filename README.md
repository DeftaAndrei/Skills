I want to say that it's an adapted version of my first version of my cv that I made which I kept coming back to because I see that I really like to do webproject and I keep thinking how to improve what I've already done by realizing a few larger projects I'm starting to understand everything better
I mean it's not perfect yet, but I can say it took me a little time

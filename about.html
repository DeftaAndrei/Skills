    <p>
        I am a passionate software developer eager to work on diverse projects, particularly in backend development. 
        I enjoy building applications using Python, with a strong focus on machine learning and data analysis, 
        and I also leverage Java alongside Flask for robust web development.

        Beyond coding, I like to experiment with different technologies to expand my expertise. 
        I manage my own Debian-based server, which serves as a playground for various projects and experiments. 
        Additionally, I explore cybersecurity by testing vulnerabilities using Kali Linux, 
        enhancing my practical understanding of secure software practices.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the frontend, I work with React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web experiences. 
        My commitment to continuous learning drives me to seek new challenges and innovate across all aspects of software development.
